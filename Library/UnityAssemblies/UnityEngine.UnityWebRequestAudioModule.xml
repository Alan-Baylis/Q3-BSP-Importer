      <summary>
        <para>A <see cref="UnityEngine.Networking.DownloadHandler"></see> subclass specialized for downloading audio data for use as <see cref="UnityEngine.AudioClip"></see> objects.</para>
        <para>DownloadHandlerAudioClip stores received data in a pre-allocated Unity <see cref="UnityEngine.AudioClip"></see> object. It is optimized for downloading audio data from Web servers, and may perform audio data decompression and decoding on a worker thread. For use cases where you wish to download an audio clip via HTTP and use it as an <see cref="UnityEngine.AudioClip"></see> within Unity, usage of this class is strongly recommended.</para>
